# MCQ
This prgram is for making MCQs and running them. This version can be used for all subjects. 

# How it works
There are two options, you can either choose to use a tradition version, where you type in a question, the answer and false answers or you can use the Scrambled version, which does not ask any false answers, i just mixes everything up. The scrambled version is better at tasks such as learning vocabulary sheets.
